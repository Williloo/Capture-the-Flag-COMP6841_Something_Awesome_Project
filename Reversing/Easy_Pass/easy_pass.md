# Easy Pass 
The challenge gives us an executeable file, which is basically a password checker. It will pop up 'Wrong Password!' 
if the password is incorrect. Let's skip the experimenting and jump straight into the binary!

## Code 
Being an executeable file, the binary of the code is massive, so instead of a linear view, we'll take a look at the graph view.
Let's use what we know to orientate ourselves a bit: we can use the search function for 'Wrong Password!' to find where there's 
a checker for whether the password is right.
