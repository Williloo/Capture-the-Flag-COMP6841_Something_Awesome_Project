## Tracks:
- Introduction to Binary Exploitation
- Introduction to Reversing
- 2024 HackTheBoo
    - Due to limited time on the competition, and files becoming unable afterwards, this section is not complete

## Essential Tools/Knowledge:
- Binary Ninja/Ghidra: **ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL**
    - These are binary decompilers, which are critical in accessing the binaries provided in each challenge
- PwnGDB: **ESSENTIAL**
    - Allows you to analyse the code during run time, and get information from registers during code execution
    - Also helps with setting breakpoints
- Knowledge of Computer Systems: **Important**
    - Very very important for binary exploitation especially
    - A good understanding of how the stack works and operates is crucial in understanding how to perform
      a lot of the exploits, which abuse the flaws in the systems
